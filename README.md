# blender-render-scripts
Just some collection of scripts for Blender for use with automating some rendering tasks.

This targets mainly Blender 3.0+ and python 3.

## How-to-use
These are meant to be small utils, or be loaded into blender for rendering.

`blender -b ./blendfile.blend -P ./listcams.py`

`blender -b ./blendfile -P ./waffrender.py <other args for blender> -- <waffrender args>`
